# Sentiment-Analysis

The Sentiment Analysis project utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract sentiment fromreviews of  Musical Intruments sold over amazon. Beginning with rigorous text cleaning to enhance data quality, the project standardized language through stemming and lemmatization. Gram analysis provided deeper insights into language patterns, while visualization techniques like word clouds highlighted prevalent terms and sentiments.

TF-IDF vectorization enabled the transformation of text into numerical features, facilitating machine learning model training. Various algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, and Neural Networks were explored for sentiment classification, each undergoing rigorous evaluation to determine performance.

The project's goal extended beyond accurate sentiment classification to encompass broader applications such as sentiment monitoring and customer feedback analysis. By integrating NLP techniques with machine learning, the project aimed to bridge the gap between textual data and actionable insights, offering potential benefits across industries like marketing, customer service, and social media analytics.
